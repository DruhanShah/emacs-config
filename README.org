* Druhan's Emacs configuration

This configuration is heavily based off of [[https://github.com/rougier][Nicolas Rougier]]'s emacs packages and ideas. All the packages that are taken more or less verbatim from Mr. Rougier's github are in the =nano/= directory and any other configuration files are in the =not-nano/= directory.

** Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites just yet.
